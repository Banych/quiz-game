# Session: Complete R4 Content Admin (2025-12-20)

## Context
After resolving E2E test auth conflicts and verifying test suite stability (24/24 passing across 3 runs), ready to complete remaining R4 (Content Admin) features before moving to R5 (Realtime & Scoring).

## R4 Goals (from plan.md)
> **R4 – Content Admin:** Manage quizzes and media - Auth gate, CRUD UI for quizzes/questions, uploads to Supabase storage, DTO validation, audit log.

### Completed ✅
- Auth gate (Supabase Auth + middleware)
- CRUD UI for quizzes (list/create/edit/delete)
- CRUD UI for questions (list/create/edit/delete)
- DTO validation (Zod schemas throughout)

### Remaining 🎯
1. **Media Uploads** - Direct upload + client-side resizing to Supabase Storage
2. **Audit Log** - Custom Prisma table tracking all admin/session operations

## Goals

### 1. Media Upload Implementation
**Scope**: Question and quiz image uploads with client-side resizing

**Requirements**:
- Upload to Supabase Storage bucket (`quiz-media`)
- Client-side image resizing before upload (max dimensions: 1920x1080)
- Support JPEG/PNG/WebP formats
- Store image URLs in Question entity (`imageUrl` field)
- Display images in QuestionList and quiz detail views
- Optional: Quiz cover images stored in Quiz entity

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create Supabase Storage bucket and configure RLS policies
- [ ] Add `imageUrl` field to Question schema and DTO
- [ ] Implement image upload service (`src/infrastructure/storage/supabase-storage.ts`)
- [ ] Create image upload component with drag-and-drop + preview
- [ ] Add client-side resizing logic (canvas API or library)
- [ ] Integrate upload component into CreateQuestionDialog and EditQuestionDialog
- [ ] Update QuestionList to display thumbnails
- [ ] E2E tests for image upload flow
- [ ] Optional: Add `coverImageUrl` to Quiz for future use

**Libraries to Consider**:
- `browser-image-compression` - Client-side compression/resizing
- `react-dropzone` - Drag-and-drop file upload UI
- Supabase Storage JS SDK (already available)

**Deferred to R6**:
- Image optimization (WebP conversion, multiple sizes)
- CDN integration
- Advanced image editing (crop, filters)

### 2. Audit Log Implementation
**Scope**: Track all admin CRUD operations and session operations

**Requirements**:
- Custom `audit_logs` Prisma table
- Track entity type, entity ID, operation type, user ID, timestamp
- Store before/after snapshots as JSON
- Support for Quiz, Question, and Session entities
- Middleware/service layer integration
- Query API for future admin audit viewer (R6)

**Schema**:
```prisma
model AuditLog {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId      String   // Admin/host who performed action
  entityType  String   // 'quiz' | 'question' | 'session'
  entityId    String   // ID of affected entity
  operation   String   // 'create' | 'update' | 'delete' | 'start' | 'stop' | 'join'
  beforeData  Json?    // Snapshot before change
  afterData   Json?    // Snapshot after change
  metadata    Json?    // Additional context (e.g., player count for session operations)
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())

  @@index([userId])
  @@index([entityType, entityId])
  @@index([createdAt])
}
```

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add `AuditLog` model to Prisma schema
- [ ] Create migration: `yarn prisma:migrate`
- [ ] Implement `IAuditLogRepository` interface and Prisma implementation
- [ ] Create `AuditLogService` for logging operations
- [ ] Create `logAuditEvent` utility for use cases/API routes
- [ ] Integrate audit logging into:
  - Quiz CRUD operations (create/update/delete)
  - Question CRUD operations (create/update/delete)
  - Session operations (start/stop quiz, player join)
- [ ] Add audit log API endpoint: `GET /api/admin/audit-logs`
- [ ] Unit tests for AuditLogService
- [ ] Integration tests for audit log creation

**Deferred to R6**:
- Admin UI for viewing audit logs
- Filtering/searching audit logs
- Export audit logs (CSV/JSON)
- Rollback/undo functionality

## Technical Decisions

### Image Storage Strategy
**Decision**: Supabase Storage with public bucket + RLS
**Rationale**:
- Native integration with existing Supabase setup
- Built-in CDN
- RLS policies for access control
- Simple URL generation
- No additional infrastructure needed

### Client-Side vs Server-Side Resizing
**Decision**: Client-side resizing before upload
**Rationale**:
- Reduces upload bandwidth
- Faster uploads (smaller files)
- No server processing needed
- Works well with Vercel serverless limits
- Defer optimization (WebP, multiple sizes) to R6

### Audit Log Storage
**Decision**: Custom Prisma table (not Supabase built-in audit)
**Rationale**:
- Fits existing DDD-lite pattern
- Full control over schema
- Easy to query for future admin UI
- Supports filtering and rollback features
- Supabase audit is DB-level only

### Audit Log Scope
**Decision**: Log all admin CRUD + session operations
**Rationale**:
- Comprehensive audit trail for compliance
- Enables future analytics (R5)
- Supports debugging and troubleshooting
- Required for production security
- Minimal performance impact with async logging

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Audit log table created with migration
- [ ] All admin CRUD operations logged with before/after snapshots
- [ ] Session operations logged (start/stop/join)
- [ ] Supabase Storage bucket configured
- [ ] Image upload works in Question dialogs
- [ ] Images display in QuestionList
- [ ] Client-side resizing limits upload size
- [ ] E2E tests updated for image upload
- [ ] Full test suite passes (24+ tests)
- [ ] Documentation updated in dev-notes.md
- [ ] R4 marked complete in plan.md

## Next Steps (After R4 Completion)
1. **Review R5 Goals** - Realtime & Scoring
2. **Plan R5 Architecture** - Full scoring logic, round transitions, leaderboard
3. **Session Planning** - Break R5 into manageable sessions
4. **Kickoff R5** - Start with scoring engine implementation
