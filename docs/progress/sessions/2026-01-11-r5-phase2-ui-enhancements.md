# R5 Phase 2: Player & Host UI Enhancements - Complete

**Date:** 2026-01-11
**Status:** ✅ Complete (Leaderboard animations deferred)
**Branch:** feat/start-over

## Overview
Implemented scoring system UI enhancements across player and host interfaces. Players now see real-time point previews and speed indicators, while hosts see scoring configuration in their dashboard.

## Goals Achieved
- ✅ Task 1: Scoring info badge on player join/session screens
- ✅ Task 2: Live point preview during countdown
- ✅ Task 3: Speed bonus indicator after answer submission
- ✅ Task 4: Scoring config display on host dashboard
- 🔄 **Deferred:** Animated leaderboard (rank arrows, smooth transitions) - saved for R5 Phase 3 polish

## Implementation Details

### 1. Scoring Info Badge Component
**File:** [src/components/player/scoring-info-badge.tsx](src/components/player/scoring-info-badge.tsx)

- Reusable component with Radix UI Tooltip
- Displays algorithm type: "Speed Scoring", "Balanced Scoring", "Fixed Points"
- Shows decay rate label for exponential: "Gentle" (≤1.0), "Default" (≤2.5), "Aggressive" (>2.5)
- Includes helpful descriptions in tooltip
- Used in: player join form, player session screen, host dashboard header

### 2. Client-Side Scoring Calculator
**File:** [src/lib/scoring-client.ts](src/lib/scoring-client.ts)

**Key Functions:**
- `calculatePoints()`: Mirrors domain scoring logic for client-side preview
- `exponentialDecay()`: `basePoints * e^(-decayRate * (timeTaken / totalTime))`
- `linearDecay()`: Guarantees 50% minimum points
- `fixedPoints()`: No time adjustment
- `getSpeedIndicator()`: Returns emoji/label based on time ratio
  - ⚡ "Lightning fast!" (0-25%)
  - 🚀 "Fast" (25-50%)
  - ✓ "Good timing" (50-75%)
  - 🐢 "Steady" (75-90%)
  - ⏱️ "Just in time!" (90-100%)

### 3. Player Join Screen Enhancement
**File:** [src/components/player/player-join-form.tsx](src/components/player/player-join-form.tsx)

**Changes:**
- Added `quizInfo` state to store quiz settings from join response
- Display ScoringInfoBadge after successful join (before navigation)
- Updated JoinResponse type to include scoring settings
- Refactored session persistence inline (removed unused `persistSession` function)

### 4. Player Session Screen Enhancement
**File:** [src/components/player/player-session-screen.tsx](src/components/player/player-session-screen.tsx)

**Changes:**
- Import `calculatePoints()` and `getSpeedIndicator()` from scoring-client
- Calculate `livePointPreview` based on:
  - Current question's base points
  - Elapsed time (`totalTime - remainingSeconds`)
  - Quiz scoring algorithm and decay rate
- Display live preview in new card: "If you answer now: **67 pts**"
- On answer submission, show speed indicator: "Answer received! ⚡ Lightning fast! — 67 pts if correct!"

**useMemo dependencies:** Recalculates when `activeQuestionId`, `currentRemaining`, or quiz settings change

### 5. Host Dashboard Enhancement
**File:** [src/components/host/host-quiz-dashboard.tsx](src/components/host/host-quiz-dashboard.tsx)

**Changes:**
- Import ScoringInfoBadge component
- Add badge to header below join code
- Convert stats grid from 2 columns to 3 columns
- Add new "Settings" card showing:
  - Time per question
  - Skip allowed (Yes/No)
  - Scoring algorithm (Speed/Balanced/Fixed)
  - Decay rate (for exponential only)

### 6. UI Component Addition
**File:** [src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx](src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx)

- Added via `npx shadcn@latest add tooltip`
- Radix UI tooltip with portal, content, trigger
- Used by ScoringInfoBadge for algorithm descriptions

## Technical Notes

### API Response Updates
The `/api/session/join` route already returns full quiz DTOs including `settings.scoringAlgorithm` and `settings.scoringDecayRate` - no backend changes needed.

### Scoring Formula Consistency
Client-side formulas in `scoring-client.ts` match domain layer (`ExponentialDecayStrategy`, `LinearDecayStrategy`, `FixedPointsStrategy`) to ensure preview accuracy.

### Performance
Live point preview uses `useMemo` with proper dependencies to avoid unnecessary recalculations. Updates every second as countdown timer changes.

## Files Modified
- **New:** `src/components/player/scoring-info-badge.tsx` (84 lines)
- **New:** `src/lib/scoring-client.ts` (96 lines)
- **New:** `src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx` (shadcn component)
- **Modified:** `src/components/player/player-join-form.tsx` (scoring badge, state management)
- **Modified:** `src/components/player/player-session-screen.tsx` (live preview, speed indicator)
- **Modified:** `src/components/host/host-quiz-dashboard.tsx` (settings card, 3-column layout)

## Testing
- ✅ Build passes: `yarn build` compiles successfully
- ✅ Linting passes: `yarn lint --fix` resolved all errors (1 pre-existing warning in admin layout)
- 🔄 **Pending:** Unit tests for scoring-client.ts
- 🔄 **Pending:** E2E tests for UI components

## Deferred Work

### Animated Leaderboard (R5 Phase 3 or R6)
**Not implemented:**
- Smooth number transitions when scores update
- Rank change indicators (↑ gained rank, ↓ lost rank, ↔ no change)
- Highlighting current player's row
- Previous score ghosting/fade effects

**Why deferred:** Core scoring UX is complete. Animations are polish that can be added after establishing stable realtime infrastructure (R5 Phase 3-4).

**Recommended approach when implementing:**
- Use Framer Motion for smooth number animations
- Track `previousLeaderboard` in state to calculate deltas
- Add `data-current-player` attribute for CSS highlighting
- Consider React Spring for rank transition animations

## Next Steps (R5 Phase 3)

Based on [07-r5-realtime-scoring-implementation.md](docs/progress/actions/07-r5-realtime-scoring-implementation.md):

1. **Round Transitions (~2-3 days)**
   - Implement answer locking mechanism (`answersLockedAt` timestamp)
   - Build round summary view (correct answer reveal, speed distribution)
   - Add `LeaderboardSnapshot` model for historical tracking
   - Manual host control for advancing questions

2. **Connection Health & Reconnection (~2-3 days)**
   - Heartbeat ping (10s interval)
   - Disconnect detection (3 missed = 30s threshold)
   - Reconnection flow with state rehydration
   - Visual indicators for disconnected players
   - Handle late submissions (403 Forbidden)

3. **Load Testing (~1-2 days)**
   - k6 or Artillery test scenarios
   - Target: 100 concurrent players, 50 simultaneous submissions
   - Verify <300ms round trip latency
   - Document performance baselines

## Notes
- Speed indicators provide immediate positive feedback to players
- Live point preview encourages strategic decision-making (answer quickly vs. think longer)
- Host settings card helps explain quiz behavior to co-hosts
- All formulas rounded down with `Math.floor()` to match domain layer
