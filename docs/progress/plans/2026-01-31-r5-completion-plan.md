## 🔲 REMAINING Work for R5

### Phase 5: Load Testing & Performance Validation (~4 hours)

**Goal:** Verify system handles production load and meets latency targets

#### Step 1: Test Environment Setup (30 min)
- [ ] Set up k6 or Artillery CLI
- [ ] Create load test scenarios directory (`tests/load/`)
- [ ] Configure test data (quiz IDs, player credentials)

#### Step 2: Scenario 1 - Concurrent Players (1 hour)
**File:** `tests/load/concurrent-players.k6.js`

**Test Cases:**
- [ ] 10 players join quiz simultaneously
- [ ] 25 players join quiz simultaneously
- [ ] 50 players join quiz simultaneously
- [ ] 100 players join quiz simultaneously (stretch goal)

**Metrics to Measure:**
- [ ] Join latency (target: <500ms P95)
- [ ] Session creation time
- [ ] Database connection pool usage
- [ ] Memory consumption per player

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ 50 concurrent players with <500ms join latency
- ✅ No database connection pool exhaustion
- ✅ No memory leaks after 10-minute test

#### Step 3: Scenario 2 - Answer Submission Storm (1 hour)
**File:** `tests/load/answer-submission-storm.k6.js`

**Test Cases:**
- [ ] 10 players submit answers within 1 second
- [ ] 25 players submit answers within 1 second
- [ ] 50 players submit answers within 1 second

**Metrics to Measure:**
- [ ] Answer submission latency (target: <300ms P95)
- [ ] Realtime broadcast delay (target: <300ms)
- [ ] Leaderboard calculation time
- [ ] Database write throughput

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ 50 simultaneous submissions with <300ms response time
- ✅ All players receive leaderboard updates within 500ms
- ✅ No answer data loss or corruption

#### Step 4: Scenario 3 - Presence Heartbeat Load (45 min)
**File:** `tests/load/presence-heartbeat-load.k6.js`

**Test Cases:**
- [ ] 50 players emitting heartbeats every 30s for 5 minutes
- [ ] Measure connection status update latency
- [ ] Verify no heartbeat drops

**Metrics to Measure:**
- [ ] Heartbeat processing time
- [ ] Connection status accuracy
- [ ] Host dashboard refresh performance

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ All heartbeats processed within 100ms
- ✅ Connection status updates visible to host within 5 seconds
- ✅ No false disconnections

#### Step 5: Documentation & Optimization (45 min)
- [ ] Document load test results in `docs/progress/sessions/2026-01-31-r5-load-testing.md`
- [ ] Identify bottlenecks (if any)
- [ ] Create optimization plan for P1 issues (defer P2 to R6)
- [ ] Update `docs/plan.md` with performance benchmarks

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ All target metrics met OR optimization plan documented
- ✅ No P0/P1 performance blockers for launch
- ✅ Results validated in production-like environment

---

### Phase 6: Integration & Documentation (2 hours)

#### Step 1: Update Documentation (1 hour)
- [ ] Update `docs/progress/PROGRESS.md` - Mark Phase 3 as ✅ Complete
- [ ] Update `docs/plan.md` - Mark R5 as ✅ Complete
- [ ] Create final session log: `docs/progress/sessions/2026-01-31-r5-completion.md`
- [ ] Update `README.md` - Add R5 completion notes
- [ ] Document known limitations (if any) for R6

#### Step 2: E2E Test Suite Validation (45 min)
- [ ] Run full E2E suite 3 times to verify stability
- [ ] Document any flaky tests in `docs/progress/actions/05-testing-improvements.md`
- [ ] Verify all critical user flows:
  - [ ] Admin creates quiz
  - [ ] Host starts quiz
  - [ ] Players join and submit answers
  - [ ] Round transitions with answer locking
  - [ ] Player reconnection after network loss
  - [ ] Host views connection status
  - [ ] Leaderboard updates after each question

#### Step 3: Quality Gates (15 min)
- [ ] All unit tests passing (`yarn test`)
- [ ] All E2E tests passing (`yarn test:e2e`)
- [ ] No TypeScript errors (`yarn build`)
- [ ] No ESLint errors (`yarn lint`)
- [ ] All DTOs have zod schemas
- [ ] No `any` types in production code

## Time Estimates

| Phase              | Estimated Time | Target Date |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ----------- |
| Phase 5: Load Test | 4 hours        | 2026-01-31  |
| Phase 6: Docs      | 2 hours        | 2026-01-31  |

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- All core functionality already implemented and tested
- No new features required, only validation

### Medium Risk
- Load testing may reveal performance bottlenecks
- **Mitigation:** Defer non-critical optimizations to R6 if needed

### Zero Risk
- No architectural changes required
- No breaking changes to existing APIs
- All phases already verified with E2E tests

---

## Next Steps After R5

1. **Mark R5 as Complete** in all documentation
2. **Create R6 kickoff plan** (`docs/progress/plans/2026-02-01-r6-kickoff.md`)
3. **Prioritize R6 tasks:**
   - Accessibility audit (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
   - Responsive design fixes (mobile/tablet)
   - Audit log implementation (deferred from R4)
   - PostHog analytics integration
   - Marketing landing page
   - Production deployment checklist
4. **Optional:** Merge `feat/start-over` branch to `master` after R5 validation

## Notes

**Phase 3 Discovery (2026-01-31):**
- Session log shows Phase 3 was completed on 2026-01-24
- PROGRESS.md incorrectly shows Phase 3 as 🟡 (in progress)
- All 11 steps verified complete with 214 tests passing
- E2E tests in `e2e/round-transitions.spec.ts` confirmed working
- **Action:** Update PROGRESS.md to reflect ✅ Complete status

**R5 is 80% Complete:**
- 4 out of 5 phases done (Phases 1-4 ✅)
- Only load testing (Phase 5) and documentation (Phase 6) remain
- All critical features implemented and tested
- System is functionally complete, pending performance validation

**Recommendation:**
- Complete Phase 5 (load testing) today (2026-01-31)
- Complete Phase 6 (documentation) today
- Mark R5 as ✅ Complete and move to R6 planning
- Target R6 completion by 2026-03-31 per original roadmap
