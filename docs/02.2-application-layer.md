# Step 2.2: Build and Test the Application Layer

## Objective
In this substep, we will focus on building the **Application Layer** of the project. This includes defining use cases, implementing application services, and writing unit tests to ensure the application layer integrates seamlessly with the domain layer.

---

## Plan for Step 2.2

### 1. **Define Use Cases**
Use cases represent specific actions or workflows in the application. These will be implemented in the `src/application/useCases/` folder.

- [x] **StartQuiz Use Case**:
  - Start a quiz session.
  - Update the quiz status to `Active`.
  - Initialize the timer for the quiz.
  - Save the updated quiz state to the repository.

- [x] **SubmitAnswer Use Case**:
  - Validate a player's answer for a specific question.
  - Update the player's score based on the correctness of the answer.
  - Save the updated quiz and player states to their respective repositories.

- [x] **EndQuiz Use Case**:
  - End the quiz session.
  - Update the quiz status to `Completed`.
  - Save the final quiz state to the repository.
  - Generate the leaderboard for the quiz.

### 2. **Implement Application Services**
Application services will orchestrate domain logic and interact with repositories. These will be implemented in the `src/application/services/` folder.

- [ ] **QuizService**:
  - Responsibilities:
    - Start a quiz.
    - End a quiz.
    - Fetch quiz details.
  - Interacts with the `IQuizRepository`.

- [ ] **PlayerService**:
  - Responsibilities:
    - Add a player to a quiz.
    - Update player status.
    - Fetch player details.
  - Interacts with the `IPlayerRepository`.

- [ ] **AnswerService**:
  - Responsibilities:
    - Submit an answer for a player.
    - Validate answers and update scores.
  - Interacts with the `IQuizRepository` and `IPlayerRepository`.

---

### 3. **Write Unit Tests**
Unit tests will ensure the correctness of use cases and services. These will be written in the `src/tests/application/` folder.

- [ ] **Tests for Use Cases**:
  - [ ] Write tests for the `StartQuiz` use case.
  - [ ] Write tests for the `SubmitAnswer` use case.
  - [ ] Write tests for the `EndQuiz` use case.

- [ ] **Tests for Application Services**:
  - [ ] Write tests for the `QuizService`.
  - [ ] Write tests for the `PlayerService`.
  - [ ] Write tests for the `AnswerService`.

---

### 4. **Integration with the Domain Layer**
Ensure that the application layer integrates seamlessly with the domain layer.

- [ ] Verify that use cases interact correctly with domain entities, aggregates, and value objects.
- [ ] Mock repository interfaces to simulate data persistence during testing.
