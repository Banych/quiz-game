# Quiz Game Plan

## Concept and Requirements

### Key Features
1. **Host Interface (Desktop)**:
   - Displays the current question (text, image, video, audio, or combinations).
   - Shows a timer for answering.
   - Tracks player responses and displays statistics after each round.

2. **Player Interface (Mobile)**:
   - Allows players to join a session by entering their name.
   - Displays only the input field for answers or options to choose from (the question itself is not displayed).
   - Shows a timer and updates on who has answered.

3. **Question Formats**:
   - Text-only questions.
   - Questions with images, videos (YouTube), or audio (Spotify/YouTube Music).
   - Combinations of the above.

4. **Rounds and Statistics**:
   - Group questions into rounds.
   - Show detailed player statistics after each round.

### Future Enhancements
- Leaderboards.
- Audience polls before the quiz starts.
- Sharing results on social media.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js**: Framework for server-side rendering and static generation.
- **React**: Component-based UI development.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive and modern UI design.

### Real-Time Communication
- **WebSocket/Socket.io**: For real-time updates (questions, answers, timers, statistics).

### Backend
- **API Routes**: For fetching questions, storing results, and managing sessions.
- **Database**:
  - **PostgreSQL/MySQL** with Prisma ORM for structured data.
  - **Firebase/Supabase** for quick prototyping.

### Media Integration
- **Images**: Stored locally or via CDN (e.g., Cloudinary).
- **Videos**: Embedded from YouTube or hosted locally.
- **Audio**: Played using HTML `<audio>` or Spotify API.

## Application Architecture

### Host (Desktop)
- Create and manage quiz sessions.
- Display questions, timers, and player statistics.

### Player (Mobile)
- Join sessions and answer questions.
- View only the input field for answers or options to choose from (the question itself is not displayed).
- View timers and response statuses.

### Admin Tool
- A protected route for adding, editing, and managing questions.
- Allows uploading multimedia content (images, videos, audio) for questions.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for organizing questions into rounds.

### Synchronization
- Use WebSockets for real-time updates.
- API routes for initial data loading and periodic updates.

## Development Steps

1. **Setup Project**:
   - Initialize a Next.js project.
   - Configure Tailwind CSS.

2. **Project Structure Setup**:
   - Create the folder structure for components, domain, application, and infrastructure layers.
   - Define core entities (Quiz, Question, Player, Answer) and their attributes/behaviors.
   - Implement value objects (e.g., Timer, Score) and aggregates (e.g., QuizSessionAggregate).
   - Create repository interfaces for data access.

3. **Build Host Interface**:
   - Create pages for managing sessions and displaying questions/statistics.

4. **Build Player Interface**:
   - Create pages for joining sessions and answering questions.
   - Ensure the question is not displayed, only the input field or options.

5. **Build Admin Tool**:
   - Create a protected route for managing questions.
   - Implement forms for adding/editing questions and uploading multimedia.

6. **Implement Real-Time Communication**:
   - Set up WebSocket/Socket.io for synchronization.

7. **Integrate Media**:
   - Add support for images, videos, and audio in questions.

8. **Database and API**:
   - Design database schema for questions, sessions, and results.
   - Implement API routes for data access.

9. **Testing**:
   - Test synchronization and responsiveness across devices.

10. **Launch Prototype**:
   - Deploy a local network version for testing.
