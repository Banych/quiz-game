# Step 2: Define DDD Structure

## Objective
Establish a clear and scalable structure for the application following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. This step will focus on defining the folder structure, core entities, value objects, aggregates, domain events, and repository interfaces.

---

## Plan for step 2.1

1. **Folder Structure**:
   - [x] Create a folder structure that separates the **Domain**, **Application**, and **Infrastructure** layers.
   - [x] Ensure each layer has a clear responsibility and avoids cross-layer dependencies.

2. **Define Core Entities**:
   - [x] Identify and define the core entities (`Quiz`, `Question`, `Player`, `Answer`) with their attributes and behaviors.

3. **Implement Value Objects**:
   - [x] Create value objects for reusable and immutable concepts (e.g., `Timer`, `Score`).

4. **Define Aggregates**:
   - [x] Group related entities into aggregates (e.g., `QuizAggregate` to manage `Quiz` and its `Questions`).

5. **Domain Events**:
   - [x] Define domain events to capture significant changes in the domain (e.g., `PlayerAnsweredEvent`, `QuizStartedEvent`).

6. **Repository Interfaces**:
   - [x] Create repository interfaces for data access, ensuring the domain layer is decoupled from the infrastructure.

7. **Testing**:
   - [x] Write unit tests for the domain layer to ensure the correctness of entities, value objects, and aggregates.

## Next Steps

1. **Build the Application Layer**:
   - Define use cases (e.g., `StartQuiz`, `SubmitAnswer`, `EndQuiz`) in the `src/application/useCases/` folder.
   - Implement application services in the `src/application/services/` folder to orchestrate domain logic and interact with repositories.

2. **Test the Application Layer**:
   - Write unit tests for use cases and services in the `src/tests/application/` folder.
   - Ensure that the application layer integrates seamlessly with the domain layer.

3. **Prepare for the Infrastructure Layer**:
   - Plan and implement repository classes in the `src/infrastructure/repositories/` folder.
   - Set up database models and configurations in the `src/infrastructure/database/` folder.

4. **Real-Time Communication**:
   - Begin planning WebSocket/Socket.io logic for real-time updates in the `src/infrastructure/websocket/` folder.

5. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Start integrating the domain and application layers with the frontend components in the `src/app/` folder.
