## 📖 Key Concepts

### The DTO → Entity → Service Flow
DTOs (data contracts) are validated, mapped to domain entities (business logic), orchestrated by application services, persisted via repositories. See **ARCHITECTURE.md** → **Data Flow** section.

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD-Lite)
Business rules live in pure domain layer, stay framework-agnostic. Presentation consumes DTOs, never entities. See **ARCHITECTURE.md** → **Core Architecture** and **[guides/DDD-STRUCTURE.md](guides/DDD-STRUCTURE.md)**.

### Prisma v7 + Driver Adapter
We use `@prisma/adapter-pg` for Vercel Edge compatibility. See **ARCHITECTURE.md** → **Design Decisions** → **Prisma v7 + Driver Adapter**.

### Supabase Realtime for <300ms Latency
Supabase Realtime broadcasts quiz updates. TanStack Query caches are manually updated by event handlers. See **ARCHITECTURE.md** → **Data Flow** → **Realtime Event Path**.

### Iterative Test Development
Write E2E tests by first manually exploring UI via Playwright MCP, then automating based on observations. See **PROGRESS.md** and **progress/sessions/2025-12-20-admin-question-crud-rewrite.md**.

## 🔄 Update Patterns

When documentation gets stale, please update it immediately:

- **Architecture change?** Update [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) and add an entry to [DECISION-LOG.md](DECISION-LOG.md)
- **New env var?** Update [guides/SETUP.md](guides/SETUP.md#environment-files)
- **New DTOs or layer patterns?** Update relevant guide + [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)
- **Completed work?** Append to [progress/dev-notes.md](progress/dev-notes.md) and reference session file
- **New design decision?** Add timestamped entry to [DECISION-LOG.md](DECISION-LOG.md)

**Remember**: Stale documentation is a code smell. If you find outdated info, fix it immediately or flag it in a comment.

| **Value Object**   | Immutable domain object identified by equality (Score, Timer, JoinCode)          |
| **Aggregate**      | Cluster of entities under single root (QuizSessionAggregate)                     |
| **Repository**     | Interface for persistence; Prisma implements it                                  |

| **Service**        | Facade grouping related use cases (QuizService)                                  |
| **DDD**            | Domain-Driven Design – organize code around business rules, not frameworks       |
| **Realtime**       | Supabase Realtime channel for <300ms quiz updates                                |
| **TanStack Query** | Server state cache; manages fetching, caching, mutations                         |
| **Middleware**     | Next.js middleware for auth/redirect logic                                       |
